Machine Learning Process

Data Pre-Processing
-- import the data
-- clean the data
-- split into training and test sets

Modelling
-- Build the model
-- Train the model
-- Make predictions

Evaluation
-- Calculate performance metrics
-- make a verdict


Training Set and Test Set
80% of data for training set and 20% for the test set
-- Creata a model using the 80% of the data and test the model using the 20% test set

Feature Scaling
-- Process to make sure that all your features are in the right scale for proper comparison
-- Applied to columns and never on rows
-- Multiple techniques - Normalization, Standardization
