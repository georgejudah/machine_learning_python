Machine Learning Process

Data Pre-Processing
-- import the data
-- clean the data
-- split into training and test sets

Modelling
-- Build the model
-- Train the model
-- Make predictions

Evaluation
-- Calculate performance metrics
-- make a verdict


Training Set and Test Set
80% of data for training set and 20% for the test set
-- Creata a model using the 80% of the data and test the model using the 20% test set

Feature Scaling
-- Process to make sure that all your features are in the right scale for proper comparison
-- Applied to columns and never on rows
-- Multiple techniques - Normalization, Standardization

-- Remember this rule - mostly the features will be in the first few columns and the dependant variable vector
will be in the last column

Missing data
if any of the columns are missing, you can either remove the whole row
or classic - replace the missing salary by the average of the all salaries

when having categorical data, data such as country which is a string - do one hot encoding - encoding categorical data
-- the reason is this So the Categorical data must be transformed or encoded into Numerical type before feeding data to an Algorithm, which in turn yields better results

Rule 3: we have to apply feature scaling after splitting the dataset into training and testing set
Why? The test set is supposed to be a brand new set - you will deploy it in production. You will not
modify it before working on the training set
