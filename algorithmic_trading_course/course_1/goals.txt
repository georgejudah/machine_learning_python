Project 1: Unsupervised Learning Trading Strategy
Project 2: Twitter sentiment Trading Strategy
Project 3: Intraday Strategy Using GARCH MODEL - optional

Challenges faced when applying ML to Trading
1. The past changes has reflected the current price of the stock, it's a risk to predict the future
price based off the past price.
2. Very hard to predict returns or prices.
3. Hard to predict the economic indicator.
4. Quite hard to predict return signs.


The work flow process:
1. Collect and prepare the data.
2. Develop a hypothesis for a strategy.
3. Coding the model.
4. Backtest the strategy.

What is unsupervised learning in trading?
Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained to make predictions, unsupervised learning
focuses on extracting insights from the data.

What we do ?
Download the SP500 stocks prices data.
Calculate different technical indicators and features for each stock.
Aggregate on the monthly level and filter for each month only top 150 most liquid stocks.
Calculate monthly returns for different time-horizons to add to features.
Download Fama-French Factors and calculate the rolling factor betas for each stock.
For each month fit a K-means clustering model to group similar assets based on their features.
For each month select assets based on the cluster and form a portfolio based on Efficient
