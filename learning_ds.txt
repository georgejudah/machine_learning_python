Having the mindset of a data scientist
# First, carefully formulate the question - clear and well formulated question will
determine the research and also affect the kind of data being gethered
# Gathering the data
# Clean the data - 
# Explore the data and visualize it
# Train the algorithm - Linear regression
# Evaluate the algorithm


#Data cleaning
- Missing data
- Incomplete data
- inaccurate data
- Formatting data
-- Feel like it'll be easier/better to format the data maximum using excel and then import the data to python

# Many times, you might be doing the cleaning and the exploration side by side, going back and forth


# Machine learning solution process steps - The cycle
# Prediction
# Calculate the error - measure how good the prediction looks
# Learn and adjust the inital prediction to have a smaller error

# Jargons
# Optimization, # Cost functions/ Loss function

# First six questions you ask yourself when presented with a new dataset
- Source of the data
- Description of the data set
- Number of data points
- Number of features
- Names of the features
- Description of the features
