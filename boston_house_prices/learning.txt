# Correlation is the statistical method of a linear relationship between 2 variables
# Correlation is a number between -1(positive negative correlation) and 1(positive correlation) and 0 means no Correlation
# Strength and Direction of the correlation is very important

# if 2 features were perfectly correlated, it could be a bad thing, something which we should discover early on
# Multi Collinearity
# is when two or more predictives in regression are highly related to one another
# For example if you're trying to find the correlation between bone density and 2 variables, body fat and
# body weight, for most of the population the 2 features, body fat and weight haave positive correlation.
# Each of these do not provide unique and independent information to the regression

# In this case, the estimates start becoming unreliable and non sensical findings, the model starts getting
confused. One more important thing is that high correlation betweem features doesn't automatically mean multi collinearity

# We should investigate the high correlation between the features


# If a feature is not adding any explanatory value, it's often better to exclude it

# Correlation does not imply causation. Linear relationship only
# Look at the value of correlation with relationship to charts visually
